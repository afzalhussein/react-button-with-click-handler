# react-button-with-click-handler

Certainly! Here's a simple React component that represents a button with an `onClick` handler:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyButton() {
  // Define a function to handle the button click event
  const handleClick = () => {
    // Add your custom logic here
    alert('Button Clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
}

export default MyButton;
```

In this example:

- We create a functional component called `MyButton`.
- Inside the component, we define an `onClick` event handler function called `handleClick`. You can customize this function to perform any action you want when the button is clicked.
- The button element is rendered with the text "Click Me" and an `onClick` attribute that references our `handleClick` function.

You can use this `MyButton` component in your React application to add a button with a click handler. Import it into your desired React component and include it in your JSX code like any other React component.
